    https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous 
    visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond 
    California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post 
    a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: 
    http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can visit our site anonymously.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts 
    parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to 
    protect children's privacy and safety online.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in 
    the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy 
    laws that protect personal information.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will notify you via email</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Within 7 business days</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and 
    processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or 
    government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails 
    stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</span></li>
