        <p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond 
            California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post 
            a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: 
            http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can visit our site anonymously.</span></p>

        <p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts 
            parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to 
            protect children's privacy and safety online.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in 
            the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy 
            laws that protect personal information.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will notify you via email</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Within 7 business days</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and 
            processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or 
            government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails 
            stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</span>
        </p>
